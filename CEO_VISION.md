# MetaAds: Strategic Vision & Execution Plan

## Our Mission
Build the "Cursor for Meta Ads" - an AI-powered platform that makes Meta advertising as simple as having a conversation.

## The Problem We're Solving
1. **Complexity**: Meta Ads Manager is overwhelming for most businesses
2. **Time**: Manual campaign management takes hours daily
3. **Expertise Gap**: Small businesses can't afford agencies or experts
4. **Optimization**: Most advertisers leave money on the table due to poor optimization

## Our Solution: AI-First Automation

### Core Value Propositions
1. **Conversational Campaign Creation**: "Create a campaign targeting women 25-34 interested in fitness in NYC with $50/day budget"
2. **Autonomous Optimization**: AI agents monitor and optimize 24/7
3. **Intelligent Insights**: "Your campaign is underperforming because your audience is too broad"
4. **One-Click Fixes**: AI suggests and implements improvements

## Execution Strategy: Context Engineering

### Why Context Engineering?
- **Reliability**: 90%+ success rate vs 50% with traditional prompting
- **Speed**: Build features in hours, not days
- **Quality**: Self-correcting system catches errors before production
- **Scalability**: New developers can contribute immediately

### Our Development Process
1. **Define** → Create INITIAL.md with clear requirements
2. **Plan** → Generate comprehensive PRP with /generate-prp
3. **Build** → Execute with validation using /execute-prp
4. **Ship** → Deploy with confidence

**Remember**: We're not building another Meta Ads Manager. We're building an AI assistant that happens to manage Meta Ads. The interface disappears, the AI does the work.
