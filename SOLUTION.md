# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

Your Facebook App has **"Facebook Login for Business"** but NOT regular **"Facebook Login"**.

## The Problem:
- You have: **Facebook Login for Business** (for business integrations)
- You need: **Facebook Login** (for user authentication)

These are DIFFERENT products!

## SOLUTION OPTIONS:

### Option 1: Create a New Facebook App (FASTEST)
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/create/
2. Choose **"Consumer"** (not Business)
3. Add **Facebook Login** product
4. Use the new App ID and Secret

### Option 2: Check if Facebook Login is Available
Sometimes Facebook Login is hidden. Try this direct link:
https://developers.facebook.com/apps/1349075236218599/facebook-login/

If that doesn't work, try:
1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Look for a **"+"** or **"Add Product"** button
3. Search for **"Facebook Login"** (without "for Business")

### Option 3: Convert App Type
Your app is type "Business". You might need to:
1. Create a new app with type "Consumer" or "Gaming"
2. These app types have access to regular Facebook Login

### Option 4: Use Google OAuth Instead
Since Facebook Login isn't available, switch to Google:
1. Much simpler setup
2. No product installation required
3. Works immediately

## Why This Happened:
When you created your app as type "Business", Facebook gave you "Facebook Login for Business" which is for B2B integrations, not for regular user login.

Regular "Facebook Login" is what NextAuth expects for OAuth user authentication.

## Immediate Action:
**Create a new Facebook App:**
1. Go to: https://developers.facebook.com/apps/create/
2. Select "Consumer" or "Other"
3. Name it "MetaAds Auth"
4. Add "Facebook Login" product
5. Update your environment variables with new App ID and Secret
