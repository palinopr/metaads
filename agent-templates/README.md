## Agent Development Pattern

All agents follow the LangGraph state machine pattern:

```python
# 1. Define State
class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[List[BaseMessage], operator.add]
    # Domain-specific fields
    
# 2. Create Tools
@tool
def domain_specific_tool():
    """Tool description"""
    pass

# 3. Build Nodes
async def process_step(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Process logic
    return state

# 4. Construct Workflow
workflow = StateGraph(AgentState)
workflow.add_node("step", process_step)
workflow.add_edge("step", "next_step")
app = workflow.compile()
```

## Creating Your Own Agent

1. **Copy a template** that's closest to your use case
2. **Modify the state** to match your domain
3. **Add your tools** for integrations
4. **Define the workflow** with your business logic
5. **Test locally** using the AgentOS SDK
6. **Publish** to the marketplace

## Best Practices

### State Design
- Keep state minimal and focused
- Use TypedDict for type safety
- Include audit trail fields
- Plan for human-in-the-loop

### Tool Design
- One tool = one integration
- Clear input/output schemas
- Handle errors gracefully
- Mock external services for testing

### Workflow Design
- Start simple, add complexity gradually
- Always include error handling paths
- Add checkpoints for long-running processes
- Design for interruption and resumption

### Performance
- Minimize external API calls
- Cache frequently used data
- Use async operations
- Set reasonable timeouts

### Security
- Never store credentials in code
- Validate all inputs
- Use least privilege principle
- Audit all actions

## Marketplace Publishing

To publish your agent:

1. **Ensure quality**
   - 90%+ success rate in testing
   - Complete documentation
   - Error handling for edge cases

2. **Add metadata**
   ```python
   AGENT_METADATA = {
       "name": "Your Agent Name",
       "description": "Clear value proposition",
       "pricing": {"model": "per_use", "price": 1.00},
       "category": "Industry",
       "integrations": ["tool1", "tool2"],
       "roi_metrics": {
           "time_saved": "X hours",
           "cost_reduction": "Y%"
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Submit for review**
   - Code quality check
   - Security scan
   - Performance testing
   - Documentation review
