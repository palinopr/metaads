# üß† ULTRATHINKING: NEXT TASK ANALYSIS

## Current State
- ‚úÖ Frontend deployed: https://metaads-ai-new.vercel.app
- ‚úÖ Backend API deployed: https://metaads-python-api-production.up.railway.app
- ‚ùå Frontend and Backend NOT connected yet

## NEXT CRITICAL TASK: Connect Frontend to Backend

### Why This Is Priority #1
Without this connection:
- Users can type campaign requests
- But nothing happens when they click send
- The API exists but frontend can't reach it

### The Task: Add EXTERNAL_API_URL to Vercel

1. Add environment variable to Vercel
2. Update the API route to use external API
3. Test the connection
4. Verify campaigns can be created

This unlocks the entire platform functionality!
