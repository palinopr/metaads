# 🚨 CEO ACTION: Trigger Vercel Deployment

## If Vercel didn't auto-deploy, here's what to do:

### Option 1: Force Trigger via Git (Recommended)
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger webhook
echo "# Deploy trigger $(date)" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "🚀 Trigger Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Manual Deploy from Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/palinos-projects/metaads
2. Click "Deployments" tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
4. Or click "Create Deployment" button

### Option 3: Vercel CLI
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if needed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy directly
vercel --prod
```

### Option 4: Check Vercel Integration
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/palinos-projects/metaads/settings/git
2. Ensure GitHub integration is connected
3. Check if webhook is active
4. Click "Reconnect" if needed

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Check if push was successful:
- GitHub: https://github.com/palinopr/metaads
- Look for commit: "🚀 COMPLETE REBUILD: AI Marketing Automation Platform"

### If commit is there but no deployment:
1. Vercel webhook might be delayed (wait 2-3 minutes)
2. Check Vercel project settings for branch protection
3. Ensure "main" branch is set for production deployments
