# MetaAds Feature Request - AI Chat Streaming & Real-time Updates

## FEATURE
Enhance the existing AI chat interface with streaming responses, real-time campaign updates via WebSocket, and quick action buttons for common tasks.

## USER STORY
As a MetaAds user, I want to see AI responses stream in real-time and get live campaign updates so that the experience feels instantaneous and I'm always aware of campaign performance.

## EXAMPLES
- Similar component: `src/components/agent-chat.tsx` (current implementation)
- Similar API endpoint: `src/app/api/ai/agent/chat/route.ts`
- Similar functionality: Cursor IDE's streaming AI responses

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] AI responses stream word-by-word as they're generated
- [ ] Campaign performance updates appear in chat in real-time
- [ ] Quick action buttons for common tasks (pause campaign, adjust budget, etc.)
- [ ] Chat persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Loading indicators show AI is "thinking"
- [ ] Errors are handled gracefully with retry options

## DOCUMENTATION
- Vercel AI SDK: https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs/concepts/streaming
- Next.js 15 App Router Streaming: /docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming
- Supabase Realtime: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime

## META ADS API REQUIREMENTS
- Required permissions: ads_read (for real-time updates)
- API endpoints needed: Existing campaign endpoints
- Rate limit considerations: Use webhooks where possible

## UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Location in app: Main dashboard (already exists)
- User flow: 
  1. User types message
  2. AI response streams in with thinking indicator
  3. Real-time updates appear as chat messages
  4. Quick actions appear as buttons below relevant messages
- Mobile responsive: Yes
- Loading states needed: Yes (thinking bubbles, typing indicators)

## DATA REQUIREMENTS
- New database tables: 
  - `chat_sessions` (persist conversations)
  - `chat_messages` (store history)
- Modifications to existing tables: None
- Data retention policy: 30 days of chat history

## AI AGENT INVOLVEMENT
- Agent required: Yes (existing intelligent agent)
- Agent type: Enhanced conversational agent
- Agent capabilities needed:
  - Stream responses
  - Process real-time events
  - Execute quick actions
  - Maintain context across sessions

## PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
- Expected load: 100+ concurrent users
- Response time target: < 100ms to start streaming
- Real-time updates needed: Yes - WebSocket for campaign updates

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- Authentication required: Yes
- Authorization rules: Users only see their own campaigns
- Data sensitivity: Campaign performance data

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
- Use Vercel AI SDK for streaming
- Implement reconnection logic for WebSocket
- Cache recent messages for quick loading
- Add keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Consider adding voice input in future

## SUCCESS METRICS
- Time to first byte (TTFB) < 200ms
- 95% of messages delivered in real-time
- User engagement increases by 50%
- Average session duration increases by 30%
