# Railway Deployment Solution

## Problem Identified
The "metaads" service in Railway is configured as a Next.js application, not a Python service. This is why Python deployments keep failing with 502 errors.

## Evidence
1. Environment variables show Next.js configuration:
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*`

2. No PORT variable is set (Railway sets this automatically for web services)

3. The service expects Next.js, but we're deploying Python

## Solution

### Option 1: Create New Python Service (Recommended)
```bash
# In Railway Dashboard:
1. Go to your "Meta ads" project
2. Click "+ New"
3. Select "Empty Service"
4. Name it "metaads-python-api"
5. Connect to GitHub repo
6. Set root directory to "/"
7. Add environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Option 2: Convert Existing Service
```bash
# This requires Railway dashboard access:
1. Go to metaads service settings
2. Change build command to: pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Change start command to: gunicorn app:app
4. Remove Next.js environment variables
5. Redeploy
```

### Option 3: Deploy to Different Project
```bash
railway init -n metaads-python
railway up
```

## Working Configuration Files

### requirements.txt
```
flask==3.0.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
flask-cors==4.0.0
```

### Procfile
```
web: gunicorn app:app --bind 0.0.0.0:$PORT
```

### app.py
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return jsonify({"status": "healthy"})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8080))
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
```

## Key Learning
Railway automatically detects project type. When a service is initially set up for Next.js, it maintains that configuration even if you push Python code later. Always create service with correct type or use separate services for different stacks.
