# CSS Styling Issue - Context Engineering Initial Document

## Problem Statement
The deployed Next.js application at https://metaads-peach.vercel.app is showing unstyled content. The page displays plain text without any CSS styling, despite having Tailwind CSS configured and CSS files being generated during build.

## Current Symptoms
1. Page shows plain black text on white background
2. No gradient backgrounds visible
3. No button styling
4. No layout/spacing applied
5. Tailwind classes in HTML but not rendered

## Expected Behavior
1. Dark gradient background (slate-900 via purple-900 to slate-900)
2. Styled buttons with hover effects
3. Glass-morphism card effects
4. Purple/pink gradient text
5. Proper spacing and typography

## Technical Context
- Framework: Next.js 14.0.4 with App Router
- Styling: Tailwind CSS 3.4.17
- Deployment: Vercel
- Build: CSS files are generated but styles not applied

## Investigation Steps Needed
1. Check if CSS file is being served in production
2. Verify CSS link tags in HTML output
3. Check browser console for CSS loading errors
4. Analyze build output for CSS processing issues
5. Verify PostCSS/Tailwind configuration

## Success Criteria
- Page displays with full styling as designed
- All Tailwind classes render correctly
- No console errors related to CSS
- Consistent styling across deployments
