# Expert Detail Questions

## Q1: Should we extend the existing campaign tables in `/src/db/schema.ts` to store campaign data locally for offline access and performance?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (reduces API calls and enables faster dashboard loading)

## Q2: Will the AI agents need to use the existing Python implementation at `/src/agents/campaign-creator.py` or should we migrate everything to TypeScript?
**Default if unknown:** No (keep Python for complex AI tasks, TypeScript for API integration)

## Q3: Should the real-time monitoring use Server-Sent Events (SSE) instead of WebSockets for the campaign performance updates?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (SSE is simpler and sufficient for one-way updates from server)

## Q4: Will the autonomous AI operations require user approval before executing campaign changes above a certain budget threshold?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (safety mechanism for high-value campaigns)

## Q5: Should we implement the campaign creation flow through the existing AI Lab chat interface at `/src/app/(app)/dashboard/ai-lab/page.tsx`?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (maintains consistent UX and leverages existing infrastructure)
