# MetaAds Platform Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

MetaAds is an AI-powered Meta (Facebook) Ads management platform designed to function as "Cursor for Meta Ads" - providing intelligent, autonomous campaign management with real-time monitoring. The platform will support multiple ad accounts per user, operate autonomously with AI agents, and focus exclusively on Meta's advertising ecosystem.

## Problem Statement

Managing Meta ad campaigns requires constant monitoring, optimization, and strategic decision-making. Marketers struggle with:
- Complex campaign setup and optimization
- Time-consuming performance monitoring
- Manual budget adjustments and bid optimization
- Creative fatigue and ad copy generation
- Multi-account management complexity

## Solution Overview

An intelligent platform that:
1. **Automates campaign management** through AI agents
2. **Provides real-time performance monitoring** via SSE
3. **Supports multiple Meta ad accounts** per user
4. **Operates autonomously** with safety thresholds
5. **Integrates seamlessly** with existing Meta Ads infrastructure

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Multi-Account Management
- **Support multiple Meta ad accounts** per user account
- **Account switching** functionality in the dashboard
- **Unified view** of all accounts with aggregated metrics
- **Account-level permissions** and access controls
- **Currency and timezone** handling per account

### 2. AI-Powered Autonomous Operations
- **Four specialized AI agents**:
  - Campaign Creation Agent (strategy and setup)
  - Optimization Agent (performance tuning)
  - Creative Agent (ad copy and creative generation)
  - Analytics Agent (insights and reporting)
- **Autonomous decision-making** within defined parameters
- **User approval required** for changes above budget thresholds
- **Memory system** for context retention across sessions
- **Learning from past campaigns** to improve recommendations

### 3. Real-Time Performance Monitoring
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** for live updates
- **Dashboard with real-time metrics**:
  - CTR, CPC, CPM, ROAS
  - Budget utilization
  - Audience reach and frequency
  - Conversion tracking
- **Performance alerts** for anomalies
- **Historical data visualization** with trend analysis

### 4. Campaign Management Interface
- **AI Lab chat interface** for campaign creation
- **Conversational campaign setup** workflow
- **Visual campaign builder** as alternative
- **Bulk operations** for multiple campaigns
- **Campaign templates** and presets

### 5. Data Persistence and Offline Access
- **Local storage** of campaign data
- **Synchronization** with Meta Ads API
- **Offline dashboard access** with cached data
- **Conflict resolution** for offline changes
- **Data export** capabilities

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Schema Extensions

Add to `/src/db/schema.ts`:
```typescript
// Campaign tables
campaigns, ad_sets, ads, campaign_insights, optimization_logs
```

### 2. API Enhancements

Extend existing endpoints:
- `/src/app/api/campaigns/route.ts` - Full CRUD operations
- `/src/app/api/campaigns/[id]/insights/route.ts` - Real-time metrics
- `/src/app/api/ai/agents/[agent]/route.ts` - Agent-specific endpoints

### 3. AI Integration

- **Maintain Python agents** at `/src/agents/` for complex AI tasks
- **TypeScript wrappers** for API integration
- **Agent orchestration** via `/src/lib/ai/agent-system.ts`
- **Tool system** for Meta API operations

### 4. Real-Time Infrastructure

Implement SSE at:
- `/src/app/api/campaigns/[id]/stream/route.ts`
- `/src/components/campaign/performance-monitor.tsx`
- `/src/lib/sse/campaign-stream.ts`

### 5. Security and Compliance

- **OAuth token refresh** automation
- **Rate limiting** for Meta API calls
- **Audit logging** for all campaign changes
- **Budget threshold controls** for autonomous operations
- **Data encryption** for sensitive information

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. Extend database schema with campaign tables
2. Implement full CRUD for campaigns API
3. Set up SSE infrastructure
4. Create performance monitoring components

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Weeks 3-4)
1. Wire Python agents to TypeScript API
2. Implement agent orchestration system
3. Add memory persistence for agents
4. Create approval workflow for high-value changes

### Phase 3: Multi-Account Features (Week 5)
1. Enhance account switching UI
2. Implement aggregated metrics view
3. Add account-level settings
4. Test with multiple accounts

### Phase 4: Polish and Testing (Week 6)
1. Error handling and recovery
2. Performance optimization
3. Comprehensive testing
4. Documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Multi-Account Management
- [ ] Users can connect and manage 5+ Meta ad accounts
- [ ] Account switching takes <1 second
- [ ] Metrics aggregate correctly across accounts
- [ ] Currency conversion works properly

### AI Autonomous Operations
- [ ] Agents make optimization decisions without user input
- [ ] User approval required for changes >$100/day
- [ ] Agents learn from historical campaign data
- [ ] Context retained across sessions

### Real-Time Monitoring
- [ ] Metrics update within 30 seconds of changes
- [ ] SSE connection remains stable for 1+ hours
- [ ] Dashboard handles 1000+ campaigns efficiently
- [ ] Alerts trigger within 1 minute of anomalies

### Campaign Management
- [ ] Campaign creation via AI Lab takes <5 minutes
- [ ] All Meta campaign types supported
- [ ] Bulk operations handle 50+ campaigns
- [ ] Templates reduce setup time by 80%

## Assumptions

1. **Meta API Stability**: Graph API v18.0 remains stable
2. **Single User Focus**: No team collaboration features needed
3. **Meta-Only Platform**: No integration with other ad platforms
4. **English Language**: Interface in English only initially
5. **Desktop-First**: Mobile experience is secondary priority

## Success Metrics

- **Time Savings**: 80% reduction in campaign management time
- **Performance**: 20% improvement in average ROAS
- **Adoption**: 90% of users create campaigns via AI Lab
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for monitoring features
- **Satisfaction**: 4.5+ star user rating

## Future Considerations

- Mobile app development
- Team collaboration features
- Integration with other ad platforms
- Advanced ML models for prediction
- White-label solution for agencies
