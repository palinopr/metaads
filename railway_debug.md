# Railway Deployment Debug Info

## Current Status
- URL: https://metaads-production.up.railway.app
- Status: 502 Error - Application failed to respond
- Project: Meta ads (ID: 88cfcbd9-fe82-4bda-bb9b-fd1cf5f5688e)
- Service: metaads (ID: c94605ee-b7c1-4f83-abf1-459855353c01)

## What We've Tried
1. ✅ Removed invalid railway.json config
2. ✅ Fixed railway.toml config errors
3. ✅ Simplified app.py to minimal Flask
4. ✅ Reduced requirements.txt to basics
5. ✅ Removed railway.toml to use auto-detection

## Possible Issues
1. **Build failing** - Check Railway dashboard build logs
2. **Port binding** - Railway might expect different port config
3. **Python version** - runtime.txt might have wrong version
4. **Missing dependency** - Even basic Flask might need something else

## Next Steps
1. Check Railway dashboard at:
   https://railway.com/project/88cfcbd9-fe82-4bda-bb9b-fd1cf5f5688e/service/c94605ee-b7c1-4f83-abf1-459855353c01

2. Look for:
   - Build logs (any errors during nixpacks build?)
   - Deploy logs (is gunicorn starting?)
   - Environment variables (is PORT set?)

3. Alternative: Create new service in Railway
   - Click "+ New" in Railway
   - Choose "Empty Service"
   - Connect to GitHub repo
   - Let it auto-configure

The app works locally, so it's a Railway configuration issue.
