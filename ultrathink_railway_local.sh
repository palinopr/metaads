echo "-----------------------------------"

echo "you MUST create a NEW service for Python:"

echo "1. In Railway Dashboard:"
echo "   - Click '+ New' button"
echo "   - Select 'Empty Service'"
echo "   - Name it: metaads-python-backend"

echo "2. Then use these commands:"
echo "   npx @railway/cli@latest link -p 88cfcbd9-fe82-4bda-bb9b-fd1cf5f5688e"
echo "   npx @railway/cli@latest up --service metaads-python-backend"

echo "ðŸ“‹ METHOD 3: Fix the Crashing Service"
echo "-------------------------------------"

echo "- It's configured for Next.js"
echo "- We're pushing Python code to it"
echo "- Railway maintains initial service type"
