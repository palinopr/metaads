# CSS Fix - Pseudo Requirements Prompt (PRP)

## Root Cause Analysis
The CSS file in production contains unprocessed Tailwind directives (`@tailwind base;` etc.) instead of compiled CSS. This indicates PostCSS/Tailwind is not running during the Vercel build process.

## Solution Strategy

### Step 1: Fix PostCSS Configuration
Create proper PostCSS config that Vercel can recognize.

### Step 2: Ensure Build Process Includes CSS Processing
Verify Next.js is configured to process CSS correctly.

### Step 3: Test Locally First
Build locally and verify CSS is compiled before deploying.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Update postcss.config.js to use CommonJS format**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

2. **Update package.json scripts**
- Ensure build script doesn't skip CSS processing
- Remove any flags that might interfere

3. **Verify tailwind.config.ts content paths**
- Ensure all component paths are included
- Check for typos in content array

4. **Test build locally**
```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run build
# Check .next/static/css/*.css for compiled output
```

5. **Deploy only after local verification**

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Local build generates CSS > 50KB
- [ ] CSS file contains no @tailwind directives
- [ ] CSS file has actual Tailwind classes
- [ ] Browser shows styled page locally
- [ ] Production deployment matches local
