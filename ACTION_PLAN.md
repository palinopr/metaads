## Remember The Mission

**Every feature must pass the "Mom Test"**
Could your mom use this to advertise her business without calling you for help?

## Technical TODOs

1. Set up Meta App & get API access
2. Implement conversation state management
3. Create campaign builder that maps chat â†’ Meta API
4. Build plain English translation layer
5. Set up daily summary system

## How to Continue

1. **For new features**: Use `/generate-prp` command
2. **For implementation**: Use `/execute-prp` command
3. **Always validate**: Run tests before considering done
4. **Stay simple**: If it needs explanation, it's too complex
