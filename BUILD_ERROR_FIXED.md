# âœ… Railway Build Error FIXED

## Problem Found & Fixed
Railway was failing because `runtime.txt` had `python-3.11.8` (too specific).
Changed to `python-3.11` and pushed to GitHub.

## What Happens Now
1. Railway auto-detects the push
2. Starts new build (~1-2 minutes)
3. Should deploy successfully

## Quick Check
Go to: https://railway.com/project/88cfcbd9-fe82-4bda-bb9b-fd1cf5f5688e
- Look for "metaads-ai" service
- Should show "Building..." then "Active"

## Next Step
Once deployed, get the URL and update Vercel's EXTERNAL_API_URL.
