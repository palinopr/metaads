# Next Phase Initial Document - From Landing Page to Working Product

## Current State
- ✅ Beautiful landing page deployed at https://metaads-peach.vercel.app
- ✅ UI/UX complete with chat interface
- ✅ Basic project structure ready
- ❌ No actual AI functionality yet
- ❌ No Meta Ads integration
- ❌ No user authentication

## CEO Vision for Next 48 Hours
Transform this landing page into a WORKING MVP that can:
1. Accept natural language campaign requests
2. Use AI agents to create campaigns
3. Actually connect to Meta Ads (using existing env vars)
4. Show real results to users

## Priority Order (Context Engineering Approach)

### Phase 1: Core AI Engine (TODAY)
**Goal**: Make the chat interface actually work with AI

1. **Implement LangGraph Supervisor Agent**
   - Receives user's natural language input
   - Decides which specialist agents to invoke
   - Returns structured campaign plan

2. **Create Campaign Parser Agent**
   - Uses GPT-4 to understand user intent
   - Extracts: budget, target audience, goals, timeline
   - Structures data for Meta Ads API

3. **Wire up the frontend**
   - Connect chat interface to API endpoint
   - Show AI responses in real-time
   - Display campaign preview

### Phase 2: Meta Ads Integration (TOMORROW)
**Goal**: Actually create campaigns in Meta Ads

1. **Meta Ads Bridge**
   - Use existing environment variables
   - Create campaigns via API
   - Handle authentication flow

2. **Campaign Status Agent**
   - Monitor campaign performance
   - Provide real-time updates
   - Suggest optimizations

### Phase 3: User Experience (DAY 3)
**Goal**: Make it production-ready

1. **Authentication**
   - Supabase auth integration
   - User dashboard
   - Campaign history

2. **Onboarding**
   - Connect Meta Business Account
   - Set up payment
   - Tutorial walkthrough

## Success Metrics
- First real campaign created within 24 hours
- 10 test campaigns by end of week
- Zero manual intervention needed

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.9+ for agents
- LangGraph for orchestration
- OpenAI GPT-4 API
- Meta Marketing API
- Supabase for auth/database

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Create PRP for LangGraph implementation
2. Set up agent development environment
3. Build first working agent
4. Test end-to-end flow

## Risks to Mitigate
- Meta API rate limits
- AI response latency
- Cost management for API calls
- Error handling for edge cases

Remember: We're not building a demo. We're building the future of marketing automation. Every decision should move us closer to replacing human media buyers.
