# CSS Final Solution - Pre-build Strategy

## Problem Summary
Vercel's build environment is not processing PostCSS/Tailwind correctly for Next.js 14.0.4, resulting in unprocessed @tailwind directives in production.

## Solution
Pre-build the CSS locally and commit the compiled version to ensure proper styling in production.

## Implementation Steps
1. Build CSS locally using PostCSS CLI
2. Save the output to a static CSS file
3. Import the pre-built CSS instead of the source
4. Deploy with the pre-built CSS

This ensures the CSS is always correctly compiled regardless of the build environment.
