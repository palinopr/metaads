# MetaAds Feature Request - Meta OAuth Connection

## FEATURE
Enable users to connect their Facebook/Meta business accounts through OAuth, store access tokens securely, and manage multiple connected accounts.

## USER STORY
As a digital marketer, I want to connect my Meta business accounts to MetaAds so that I can manage my Facebook/Instagram advertising campaigns through the platform.

## EXAMPLES
- Similar component: Basic auth flow in `src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts`
- Similar API endpoint: User registration in `src/app/api/auth/register/route.ts`
- Similar functionality: NextAuth.js provider patterns (currently email/password only)

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- [ ] Users can initiate Facebook OAuth connection from dashboard
- [ ] OAuth flow redirects to Facebook for authorization
- [ ] Access tokens are stored securely with encryption
- [ ] Users can view their connected Meta accounts
- [ ] Users can disconnect accounts
- [ ] Handle OAuth errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Support for both Facebook and Instagram business accounts
- [ ] Respect Meta's API permissions and scopes

## DOCUMENTATION
- Meta Marketing API: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/getting-started
- Facebook Login for Business: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/guides/advanced/manual-flow
- NextAuth.js Facebook Provider: https://next-auth.js.org/providers/facebook
- Internal docs: requirements/REQUIREMENTS_SPEC.md#meta-connections

## META ADS API REQUIREMENTS
- Required permissions: 
  - `ads_management` - Manage advertising campaigns
  - `ads_read` - Read advertising insights and campaign data  
  - `business_management` - Access business accounts and pages
  - `pages_read_engagement` - Read page data
- API endpoints needed: 
  - `/me/accounts` - Get user's business accounts
  - `/me/businesses` - Get user's business manager accounts
  - `/act_{account_id}/` - Validate account access
- Rate limit considerations: OAuth calls are not rate limited, but account validation calls are

## UI/UX REQUIREMENTS
- Location in app: Dashboard with "Connect Meta Account" button
- User flow: 
  1. Dashboard → "Connect Account" → OAuth popup/redirect
  2. Facebook authorization → Callback → Success message
  3. Connected accounts shown in dashboard
- Mobile responsive: Yes (OAuth should work on mobile)
- Loading states needed: Yes (OAuth flow can take 5-10 seconds)

## DATA REQUIREMENTS
- New database tables: 
  - `meta_connections` (user_id, access_token, refresh_token, expires_at, scopes)
  - `meta_ad_accounts` (connection_id, account_id, account_name, currency, timezone, is_selected)
- Modifications to existing tables: None
- Data retention policy: Tokens valid for 60 days, refresh as needed

## AI AGENT INVOLVEMENT
- Agent required: No (this is pure OAuth integration)
- Agent type: N/A
- Agent capabilities needed: N/A

## PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
- Expected load: Up to 1000 OAuth connections per day
- Response time target: OAuth flow completion < 10 seconds
- Real-time updates needed: No (OAuth is one-time flow)

## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
- Authentication required: Yes (users must be logged in)
- Authorization rules: Users can only connect accounts they own
- Data sensitivity: HIGH - Access tokens allow full account management
- Encryption: All tokens encrypted at rest using ENCRYPTION_KEY
- Token refresh: Implement automatic token refresh before expiration

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS
- Facebook App Review may be required for production permissions
- Handle Facebook API versioning (currently v18.0)
- Implement proper error handling for expired/invalid tokens
- Consider implementing webhook for real-time token revocation
- Support for Facebook Business Manager vs personal accounts
- Handle edge cases: account suspended, permissions revoked, etc.

## SUCCESS METRICS
- OAuth completion rate (target: >90%)
- Token refresh success rate (target: >95%) 
- User satisfaction with connection flow
- Time to complete OAuth flow (target: <30 seconds)
- Error rate during connection process (target: <5%)
