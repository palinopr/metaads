# INITIAL - Conversational Campaign Builder

## FEATURE: Natural Language Campaign Creation System

Build a conversational interface that allows users to create complete marketing campaigns using natural language. Users should be able to describe their campaign goals in plain English and have the system automatically generate the entire campaign structure with optimal settings.

### Core Functionality

1. **Natural Language Understanding**
   - Parse campaign objectives from conversational input
   - Extract key parameters (budget, audience, duration, goals)
   - Handle ambiguous requests with clarifying questions
   - Support multiple languages (start with English)

2. **Campaign Structure Generation**
   - Create campaign hierarchy (Campaign → Ad Sets → Ads)
   - Set appropriate campaign objectives based on goals
   - Configure optimal bidding strategies
   - Generate targeting parameters

3. **Interactive Refinement**
   - Show campaign preview in real-time
   - Allow conversational modifications
   - Suggest improvements based on best practices
   - Validate against platform policies

4. **Multi-Channel Support**
   - Start with Meta (Facebook/Instagram)
   - Design for future expansion (Google, TikTok, etc.)
   - Platform-specific optimizations
   - Cross-platform campaign coordination

### Example Interactions

**User**: "I want to promote my new fitness app to women aged 25-40 who are interested in yoga and wellness, with a budget of $500 per week"

**System**: 
- Creates campaign with "App Installs" objective
- Sets up ad set targeting women 25-40
- Adds interests: yoga, wellness, meditation, fitness
- Configures $500 weekly budget with optimal daily distribution
- Suggests creative formats that work best for app installs

**User**: "Focus more on Instagram and add men too"

**System**:
- Updates placement to prioritize Instagram
- Expands gender targeting to all
- Adjusts creative recommendations for Instagram
- Recalculates budget distribution
