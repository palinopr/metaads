# ðŸ§  ULTRATHINKING: AI KEY SETUP COMPLETE

## What We Did
1. Added OPENAI_API_KEY to Railway service âœ…
2. Redeployed the service to apply changes âœ…
3. Created placeholder key for security âœ…

## CRITICAL: Replace Demo Key with Real OpenAI Key

The current key is a demo placeholder. To enable real AI:

```bash
# Replace with your actual OpenAI API key
railway variables --set "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-YOUR-REAL-API-KEY-HERE" --service metaads-python-api

# Deploy changes
railway up --service metaads-python-api
```

## Getting an OpenAI API Key

1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in or create account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (starts with sk-)
5. Add it to Railway using command above

## Cost Estimates
- GPT-3.5: ~$0.002 per campaign (recommended for testing)
- GPT-4: ~$0.03 per campaign (better quality)

## Test After Adding Real Key

```bash
# Test with specific campaign request
curl -X POST https://metaads-python-api-production.up.railway.app/api/campaign/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "I need Facebook ads for my Brooklyn vegan restaurant targeting health-conscious millennials with $500/month budget",
    "userId": "test"
  }'
```

## Expected Results

### With Demo Key (Current):
- Generic campaign names
- Template responses
- No real intelligence

### With Real Key:
- Brooklyn-specific targeting
- Health & vegan keywords
- Millennial-focused copy
- Budget optimization suggestions
- Competitor insights

## Next Steps After Real Key
1. Test AI agent responses
2. Verify intelligent campaign generation
3. Monitor token usage in OpenAI dashboard
4. Adjust model selection for cost/quality balance
