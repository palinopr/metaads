# INITIAL: Debug and Fix Railway Deployment Issue

## Context
We have a Flask app that won't deploy on Railway. Getting 502 errors despite multiple attempts. Need to use Railway CLI to diagnose and fix.

## Current State
- URL: https://metaads-production.up.railway.app (502 error)
- Simple Flask app with minimal dependencies
- Railway CLI is installed and authenticated
- Connected to "Meta ads" project

## Diagnostic Steps Needed
1. Get actual deployment logs from Railway CLI
2. Check build output
3. Verify environment variables
4. Test locally with same conditions
5. Fix and verify deployment works

## Success Criteria
- App responds with 200 OK at root path
- Can access /api/campaign/create endpoint
- No 502 errors
- Document solution for future reference
