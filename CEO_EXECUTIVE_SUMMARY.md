## Financial Projections

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Revenue | $10M | $50M | $200M |
| Agents | 1,000 | 10,000 | 100,000 |
| Businesses | 10K | 100K | 1M |
| Developers | 500 | 5,000 | 50,000 |
| Valuation | $100M | $500M | $2B |

## Why I'm Confident

1. **Market Pull**: Every business needs this
2. **Technical Foundation**: LangGraph is production-ready
3. **Go-to-Market**: Clear path via marketplace
4. **Team**: We have the core expertise
5. **Timing**: AI wave is just beginning

## The Decision

We stand at a crossroads:
- **Option A**: Continue as MetaAds, compete on features, linear growth
- **Option B**: Transform to AgentOS, create new category, exponential growth

I strongly recommend Option B. The window to become the "operating system for business AI" is open now but won't stay open long.

## Next Steps

1. **Board Meeting**: Present transformation plan
2. **Team All-Hands**: Share the vision
3. **Customer Advisory**: Get feedback from top 10
4. **Technical Spike**: Prove LangGraph integration
5. **Fundraising**: Begin Series A conversations
