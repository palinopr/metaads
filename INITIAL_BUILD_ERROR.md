# INITIAL: Railway Build Error Diagnosis

## Context
User created new Python service on Railway but build failed. Need to diagnose and fix using systematic approach.

## Problem Found
Railway doesn't support specific Python patch versions (3.11.8). Must use major.minor format only.

## Solution Applied
1. ✅ Changed runtime.txt from `python-3.11.8` to `python-3.11`
2. ✅ All other files are correctly configured:
   - app.py: Flask app with health endpoint
   - requirements.txt: Minimal dependencies
   - Procfile: Correct gunicorn configuration

## File Structure Verified
```
metaads-new/
├── app.py              ✅ Flask app
├── requirements.txt    ✅ flask, gunicorn, flask-cors
├── Procfile           ✅ web: gunicorn app:app
└── runtime.txt        ✅ python-3.11 (fixed)
```

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Railway will auto-deploy
3. Monitor build logs
4. Verify deployment success
