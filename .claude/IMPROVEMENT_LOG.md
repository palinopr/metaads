# Context Improvement Log

This file tracks improvements and discoveries made during development that should be incorporated back into the project's context engineering setup.

## Improvement Guidelines

When working on any task, watch for:
1. **Repeated Patterns** - Document in `examples/`
2. **Better Approaches** - Update existing examples
3. **Common Pitfalls** - Add to CLAUDE.md anti-patterns
4. **Missing Context** - Enhance templates and documentation
5. **Validation Gaps** - Add new validation steps

## Recent Discoveries

### [Date] - [Feature/Task Name]

### 2025-07-03 - Initial Context Engineering Implementation
**Discovery**: Setting up and running projects requires significant context beyond code
**Current Approach**: Minimal documentation, rely on AI to figure out setup
**Better Approach**: Comprehensive setup docs, validation checklists, troubleshooting guides
**Action Taken**: 
- [x] Created SETUP.md with step-by-step instructions
- [x] Added Pre-Development Checklist to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Created DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md for common tasks
- [x] Created COMMON_ISSUES.md for troubleshooting
- [x] Updated PRP template with setup verification

### 2025-07-03 - Development Environment Management
**Discovery**: Dev environment state significantly impacts development success
**Current Approach**: Assume environment is ready
**Better Approach**: Always verify environment state before development
**Action Taken**: 
- [x] Added environment checks to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Documented background process management
- [x] Added quick verification commands
- [x] Created troubleshooting for common env issues

### 2025-07-03 - Working Directory and Path Issues
**Discovery**: Bash cd commands fail in certain contexts, causing setup failures
**Current Approach**: Use cd for navigation
**Better Approach**: Use absolute paths or stay in current directory
**Action Taken**: 
- [x] Documented in CLAUDE.md gotchas
- [x] Added examples using absolute paths
- [x] Included workarounds in COMMON_ISSUES.md

### Example Entry:
### 2025-01-03 - MetaAds Context Setup
**Discovery**: Found that MetaAds uses specific error handling patterns for Meta API
**Current Approach**: Generic error handling
**Better Approach**: Specific Meta API error codes with retry logic
**Action Taken**: 
- [x] Added Meta API error handling to `examples/api-route-pattern.ts`
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md with Meta API rate limit gotchas
- [ ] Create specific Meta API integration example

## Pending Improvements

1. **SSE Implementation Pattern** - Need to document the Server-Sent Events pattern used for real-time updates
2. **AI Agent Communication** - Document the Python/TypeScript bridge pattern
3. **Campaign State Machine** - Document the campaign status transitions
4. **Batch Operations** - Add examples for bulk Meta API operations
5. **Python Agent Examples** - Create `examples/agent-pattern.py` with standard patterns
6. **Testing Patterns** - Add comprehensive testing examples to examples/
7. **CI/CD Workflow** - Document deployment and continuous integration setup
8. **Performance Optimization** - Create examples for caching, lazy loading, etc.
9. **Meta Sandbox Setup** - Document how to set up Meta test accounts
10. **Production Environment** - Create production setup guide separate from dev

## Context Quality Checklist

Before considering context complete for a feature:
- [ ] All new patterns documented in examples/
- [ ] Gotchas added to CLAUDE.md
- [ ] PRP template updated if new sections needed
- [ ] Validation commands verified and documented
- [ ] Error handling patterns captured
- [ ] Performance considerations noted
