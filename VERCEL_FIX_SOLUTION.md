# üö® VERCEL DEPLOYMENT ISSUE - SOLUTION

## The Problem
Vercel main domain (metaads.vercel.app) is showing the OLD marketplace site, not our NEW AI Marketing Platform.

## Root Cause
1. Password protection is enabled on the Vercel project
2. New deployments can't be promoted to production
3. The old deployment is stuck as the main site

## SOLUTION OPTIONS

### Option 1: Fix in Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/palinos-projects/metaads/settings/general
2. Find "Password Protection" section
3. **Turn it OFF**
4. Go to Deployments tab
5. Find a recent deployment (from today)
6. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"

### Option 2: Create New Vercel Project
```bash
# Create completely new project
cd /Users/jaimeortiz/Test\ Main/metaads-new
npx vercel --name metaads-ai-platform

# This will create a fresh project without restrictions
```

### Option 3: Use Railway Frontend
The "metaads" service on Railway is building our Next.js frontend as backup.
Check status:
```bash
railway logs --service metaads
railway domain --service metaads
```

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Working
- **Python API**: https://metaads-python-api-production.up.railway.app
- **API Endpoints**: All working perfectly

### ‚ùå Not Working
- **Vercel Frontend**: Showing old marketplace site
- **New Deployments**: Password protected

## Quick Test

Your backend is working:
```bash
curl -X POST https://metaads-python-api-production.up.railway.app/api/campaign/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Create Facebook ads $100/day", "userId": "test"}'
```

## Action Required

To get your AI Marketing Platform live:

1. **Go to Vercel Settings**
2. **Disable Password Protection**
3. **Promote Latest Deployment**

Or create a new Vercel project without restrictions.

Your backend is ready - just need to expose the frontend!
