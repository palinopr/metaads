# üß† ULTRATHINKING INITIAL: Connect AI Agents to Backend

## Current State Analysis
- ‚úÖ AI agents implemented in `src/agents/`
- ‚úÖ Flask backend deployed and running
- ‚úÖ OpenAI API key configured (demo)
- ‚ùå Flask app doesn't use the agents
- ‚ùå Returns hardcoded demo campaigns

## The ONE Task: Wire AI Agents to Flask API

### Success Criteria
When user sends: "Create Facebook ads for my vegan restaurant in Brooklyn"
- AI agents analyze the request
- Generate personalized campaign
- Return intelligent response
- Not generic templates

### Technical Requirements
1. Import workflow in app.py
2. Handle async LangGraph in Flask
3. Parse real user messages
4. Return AI-generated campaigns

### Implementation Plan
```python
# In app.py
from src.agents.workflow import create_campaign_workflow

@app.route('/api/campaign/create', methods=['POST'])
async def create_campaign():
    # Get user message
    # Run through AI workflow
    # Return intelligent response
```

### Context Engineering Approach
1. Start with minimal connection
2. Test with real API call
3. Handle errors gracefully
4. Deploy incrementally

### Expected Outcome
```json
{
  "campaign": {
    "name": "Brooklyn Vegan Paradise - Health Conscious Campaign",
    "targeting": {
      "location": "Brooklyn, NY",
      "interests": ["veganism", "healthy eating"],
      "age": "25-34"
    }
  },
  "content": [{
    "headline": "Plant-Based Perfection in Brooklyn",
    "text": "Fresh, local, sustainable. Your neighborhood vegan haven.",
    "cta": "Reserve Your Table"
  }],
  "mode": "ai",
  "reasoning": "Targeted millennials in Brooklyn with health-focused messaging"
}
```

## One Task, One Focus
Connect the existing AI agents to the deployed Flask backend. Nothing more, nothing less.
