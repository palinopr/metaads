# Vercel Python Deployment Status

## Current Situation

We've implemented Python AI agents using LangGraph, but deploying Python functions on Vercel has some challenges:

1. **Python Runtime Limitations**: Vercel's Python runtime has specific requirements and doesn't support all Python packages
2. **Import Issues**: Complex imports from our agent system may not work in Vercel's serverless environment
3. **Cold Start Times**: Python functions can have longer cold start times

## Working Solution

The AI agents are fully functional and can be deployed using these approaches:

### Option 1: Use Node.js API Route (Currently Working)
- The existing `/api/campaign/create` endpoint works
- It returns demo data when no Python process is available
- This is sufficient for MVP demonstration

### Option 2: Deploy Python Service Separately
Best options for production:

1. **Railway.app** (Recommended)
   - Easy deployment from GitHub
   - Supports all Python dependencies
   - WebSocket support for real-time updates
   - $5/month for starter

2. **Google Cloud Run**
   - Serverless containers
   - Auto-scaling
   - Pay per use
   - More complex setup

3. **Render.com**
   - Similar to Railway
   - Free tier available
   - Good Python support

### Option 3: Simplify for Vercel
To make Python work on Vercel:
- Remove heavy dependencies
- Use simple HTTP responses
- Pre-package the agents
- Use edge functions instead

## Current Demo Mode

The platform works in demo mode:
- Frontend: âœ… Deployed and working
- API: âœ… Returns demo campaigns
- AI Agents: âœ… Work locally with OpenAI key
- Production: ðŸ”„ Requires separate Python deployment

## Next Steps

1. **For Demo/MVP**: Current setup is sufficient
2. **For Production**: Deploy Python service on Railway or Cloud Run
3. **For Scale**: Consider AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions

## Testing Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r agent-requirements.txt

# Set OpenAI key
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'

# Run tests
python test_agent_workflow.py
python demo_ai_agents.py
```

## Environment Variables Needed

For production deployment:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
META_APP_ID=...
META_APP_SECRET=...
META_ACCESS_TOKEN=...
